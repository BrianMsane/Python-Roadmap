    "# ðŸŒ€ Python Loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Loops in Python are fundamental _control structures_ used to **repeat** a block of code multiple times, either for a **specific number of iterations** or **until a condition is met**. They make programs more efficient by reducing repetition and increasing automation. In programming we have a principle called **Do not repeat yourself** which is popularly known as the _DRY_ principle which can be implemented using loops\n",
    "\n",
    "Python provides **two main types of loops**:\n",
    "1. **`for` loop** â€“ Iterates over a sequence (like a list, tuple, string, or range).\n",
    "2. **`while` loop** â€“ Repeats a block of code as long as a specified condition is `True`.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also use **nested loops**, and **loop control statements** such as `break`, `continue`, and `pass`. Nesting a loop is basically having one loop inside the block of another loop. You can nest as many loop as you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Loop Control Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "- break; Stops the loop completely when a condition is met\n",
    "- continue; Skips the rest of the code in the current iteration and moves to the next one\n",
    "- pass; Used as a placeholder when you want a block of code syntactically but donâ€™t want it to do anything yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Make sure not to have `infinite loops` which is a loop which _runs forever and does not have a condition to stop_. This might crush your RAM.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### ðŸ”¹The `for` Loop\n",
    "\n",
    "The `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over **iterable objects** such as lists, tuples, dictionaries, strings, or ranges.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "for variable in sequence:\n",
    "    # Code block to execute\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A nested loop is a loop inside another loop. Commonly used for working with multi-dimensional data (like lists of lists).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Mandatory to understand\n",
    "\n",
    "- range()\n",
    "- enumerate()\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "- When execution leaves a scope, all automatic objects that were created in that scope are destroyed.\n"
