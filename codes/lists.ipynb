    "\n",
    "A list is a collection of items. These items should be arranged in a list format because they means someting together. For instance, the list of siblings or the list of prime numbers. In Python, square brackets `[]` indicate a list, and individual elements in the list are separated by commas. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "siblings = ['Noncedo', 'Sihlelelwe', 'Ncobizwe', 'Slindokuhle', 'Ncengwa']\n",
    "```\n",
    "It is important to follows the rules of naming variables when naming the lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indexing Accessing Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "When you print the list you are going to use `print(list_name)` which is going to print everything including the square brackets. But this is not ideal and sometimes you would want to only use asingle element from the list. \n",
    "\n",
    "Lists are ordered collections, so you can access any element in a list by telling Python the position, or index, of the item desired. To access an element in a list, write the name of the list followed by the index of the item enclosed in square brackets. In some programming languages the index starts from 0 and typically these are the C-style of languages which include `['C', 'C++', \"Java\", \"Python\", \"JavaScritp\", \"etc.,\"]`. This means that if you want to print 'Noncedo' from the list of siblings you are going to use the syntax below.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "print(siblings[0])\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that when the index starts from 0, it means that it will end at `n - 1` where n is the number of elements in the list. To get the length or number of elements in the list you can easily use the `len()` function and pass the name of the list within the paranthese.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note üí°\n",
    " - The elements in the list does not have to be unique; you can have multiple values which are the same. Say for instance my mother decides to have another child and names her \"Noncedo\" now the list of my siblings will be, `['Noncedo', 'Sihlelelwe', 'Ncobizwe', 'Slindokuhle', 'Ncengwa', 'Noncedo']` ü§ó\n"

    "### Modifying\n",

    "In python, lists elements can be modified or `mutable` meaning that you can Delete, Replace/Update, Add new value to the list. These can be using the subscript syntance or using some methods which include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `append(x)`; add element x at the end of the list\n",
    "- `pop()` or `pop(i)`; when i is specified the item at index _i_ is retrieved and also removed from the list, if _i_ is not specified the this operation applies to the element at the end of the list.\n",
    "- `remove(x)`; removes/delets element x from the list without specifying the index value.\n",
    "- `del list_name[index]`; removes an element at the specified index\n",
    "- `extend()`\n",
    "- `copy()`\n",
    "- `clear()`\n",
    "- `insert(index, element)`; inserts `element` into `index` \n",
    "- `reverse()`\n",

    "All these methods allows for flexibility when working with lists in Python as the assumption is that you don't initially know the data that you will be storing in your list until the program is running. Simply put, before giving birth to any babies, my mom did not know the names of all her children üòäüíØ\n",
