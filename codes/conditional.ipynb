    "# Conditional Programming ‚úÖ‚ùå\n",
    "\n",
    "Conditional statements in programming are used to **control the flow of a program based on certain conditions**. These statements allow the execution of different _code blocks_ depending on whether a specified condition evaluates to _true or false_, providing a fundamental mechanism for decision-making in algorithms.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the heart of every if statement is an **expression** that can be evaluated as True or False and is called a **conditional test**. These tests often include _comparison operators, membership operators, or any expression that evaluates to a Boolean value_. Python uses the values True and False to decide whether the code in an if statement should be executed. If a conditional test evaluates to True, Python executes the code following the if statement. If the test evaluates to False, Python ignores the code following the if statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Types of Conditional Statements\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `if` statement\n",
    "2. `if...else` statement\n",
    "3. `if...elif...else` statement\n",
    "4. `Ternary` operator\n",
    "\n",
    "Several different kinds of conditional statements exist, as shown above, and your _choice of which to use depends on the number of conditions you need to test_. Specifically, if you have one condition then `if` statements works for you, two `if ... else` should work and more that that means you are going to use `if...elif...else`. With the latter, you can have as many `elif` conditional tests as you require.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Indentation \n",
    "\n",
    "In python a _block of code is indented to indicate that the statements within that block belong to a specific section_. In contrast to many other languages which use `{}` to indicate the block, Python uses a colon to indicate the start of a block and all statements that are indented belong to that block. Typically, the indentation is _4_ `whitespaces` or one `tab` and depending on how you chained the conditions, these spaces might increase.\n"

    "## üß© `if` Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The `if` statement is used to test a single condition and a single action. If the condition evaluates to **True**, the indented block of code runs; otherwise, it‚Äôs skipped.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Syntax\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if condition:\n",
    "    # code to execute if condition is true\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The colon terminates the conditional statement and then creates a new block of code underneath it. You can have as many lines of code as you want in the block following the if statement. If the conditional test evaluates to True, Python executes the code following the if statement. If the test evaluates to False, Python ignores the code following the if statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example; let's say you want to determine if a person will be able to vote based on their age. The legal voting age is 18. So, what you have to do in this case is to compare to see if the person's age is `greater or equal` the legal voting age. Note that `>=` is a comparison operator which returns either True of False. \n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 23\n",
    "if age >= 18:\n",
    "    print('You can vote')\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Because 23 is greater than 18, the person is allowed to vote. In other words, because the conditional test `27 >= 18` evaluates to `True`, the statement `print('You can vote')` can be executed.  If age was 16, then the person would not have been allowed to vote meaning that the conditional test would have evaluated to `False`, hence the `print('You can vote')` statement which is within the if block would have not been executed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note; you can have multiple conditions which are chained together using the logical operators `and`, `or` and `not`. For instance, if you want only males over the age of 18 to vote you can have the condition as follows.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "age = 23\n",
    "gender = 'male'\n",
    "\n",
    "if age >= 18 and gender == 'male':\n",
    "    print(\"You are allowed to vote man üòÇ\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember: the `and` operator needs both conditions to evalute to `True` in order for it to return `True`. To confirm this you can refer to the basics notebook [here](./basics.ipynb)"
