    "We have noticed how **looping or control structures** can help us _run multiple lines of code for a specified number of times or until a condition is met_. At the same time, loops alleviate the need for writing the same statements multiple times which makes the code easy to ready and convenient. We can also use functions to group some statements which perform a certain operation together. These statements, when grouped, can then be re-used multiple times depending on the need. This help us because repeating statemetns multiple times makes it hard to read, maintain, and debug.\n",

    "In Python we have two types of functions which are:\n",
    " - **Built-in functions**. These are the functions which come pre-defined with Python such as `print()`, `input()` and so on. You basically do not write their code yourself. All you do is read about how the function is used and pass the important arguments to use them.\n",
    " - **User-defined functions**. These are the kinds of functions which do not come built-in Python but the user define them based on his need. For instance, if I want functionality which will diagnose patients if they are infected with Tuberculosis or not I can define a function for that. To define these functions you use the `def` keyword. This will be demonstrated below."
