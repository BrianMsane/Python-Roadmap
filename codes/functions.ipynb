    "We have noticed how **looping or control structures** can help us _run multiple lines of code for a specified number of times or until a condition is met_. At the same time, loops alleviate the need for writing the same statements multiple times which makes the code easy to ready and convenient. We can also use functions to group some statements which perform a certain operation together. These statements, when grouped, can then be re-used multiple times depending on the need. This help us because repeating statemetns multiple times makes it hard to read, maintain, and debug.\n",

    "In Python we have two types of functions which are:\n",
    " - **Built-in functions**. These are the functions which come pre-defined with Python such as `print()`, `input()` and so on. You basically do not write their code yourself. All you do is read about how the function is used and pass the important arguments to use them.\n",
    " - **User-defined functions**. These are the kinds of functions which do not come built-in Python but the user define them based on his need. For instance, if I want functionality which will diagnose patients if they are infected with Tuberculosis or not I can define a function for that. To define these functions you use the `def` keyword. This will be demonstrated below."

    "These are the functions which comes with Python when you install it and typical examples include `print()`, `input()`, `dir()`, and many more. In this section, we will briefly review some of the most commonly used ones. We have been using `print()` for quite some time in this series without knowing what it is (_its a built-in function_) but only what it does ðŸ˜‚.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `input()` is used for getting input from the user. For instance, you might want to get the user's age or name into the program so that you compute specific operations. **By default, the it function takes the input to be the string data type**. _To convert it between data types you can use the following constructors_.\n",
    "    - `int()` to convert the input into an integer\n",
    "    - `float()` to convert the input into a floating point number\n",
    "    - `bool()` to convert the input into a Boolean type\n",
    " When you use the input() function, you might want to specify a prompt which informs the user of the specific information they have to provide. For instance, when you want the user to provide his age you could say, `'What is your age?'`. This is done by providing a string within the parenthesis of the `input()` function.\n",
    "- `dir()` is used to list all the attributes and methods of an _object_. The object can be of any type as long as it is _Pythonic_. This operation is essential when you want to use the object and you are trying to figure out what you can do with the object.\n",
    "- `type()` is used for getting the data type of a Python object such as a variable, class instance, and many more. It can be used to confirm the data type of the object. Similarly, in a program you can use functions like `isinstance()` to confirm if a Python object is of a particular data type or not."
