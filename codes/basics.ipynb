    "# Introduction to Python 🐍 Programming\n",
    "\n",
    "_**By: Brian Msane**_\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Programming?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Programming** allows us to _communicate instructions to computers_. At their core, computers understand only sequences of zeros and ones, often called _machine code or binary_. Writing directly in machine code is incredibly difficult 🤔 and time-consuming. Programming languages act as intermediaries, providing a more human-readable way to write these instructions, which are then translated into a form the computer can execute.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is Python\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python** is one such language which is said to be a **high-level, general purpose, interpreted** language. **High-level** means that the syntax allows you to write in your _plain natural language which is more similar to English_ in the case of Python. These allows for ease of use with people and breaks the barriers of entry for many. It is called **interpreted** because code is typically _executed line by line by a program called an interpreter_. When you run a Python script, the interpreter reads your code and performs the actions specified almost immediately. This is in contrast to many langages like C++ which are compiled langauges. Lastly, it is said to be a **general-purpose** langauge because it was not designed for a specific task; you can program backends, do machine learning, game programming, and many for tasks like data engineering, analsysis, and science.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interpreter\n",
    "\n",
    "When you open an editor or IDLE and run the code `print(\"Hello world\")` something magical happens 😂.  **Your editor then runs the file through the Python interpreter, which reads through the program and determines what each word in the program means.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that we used the phrase _Python interpreter_, what really is it? _An interpreter is a program that translates high-level code into machine code line-by-line starting from the top to bottom, allowing the computer to execute the instructions_. It executes code line-by-line rather than compiling the entire program into machine code before execution and this allows for the flexibility and ease of debugging as errors are identified on the fly\n",
    "\n",
    "##### How does the Interpreter work?\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python Interpreter contains two components, namely `compiler` and `Python Virtual Machine`. When you run a Python script, the interpreter first compiles the source code into an intermediate format called **bytecode**. This bytecode is not machine code but a lower-level, platform-independent representation of the source code. The bytecode is then executed by the _PVM_, which translates it into **machine code** that the processor can understand and execute. This two-step process allows Python to be both interpreted and compiled, providing a balance between flexibility and performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Types of Interpreters\n",
    "\n",
    "- Interactive Mode allows you to execute Python commands one at a time and see the results of immediately. To start this, after installing Python, you can use one of the options below.\n",
    "    - Search IDLE on start and click Enter. A Python `Integrative Development and Learning Environment` window will pop-up where you are prompted by `>>>` to start writing your code\n",
    "    - Go to the command line interface and then type the `python` command and you will see a result similar to the one in the image below.\\\n",
    "    ![running python from the terminal](../pics/terminal.png)\n",
    "- Script mode allows you to create python file with a `.py` file extension and then write multiple lines of code and then run the file to see the results of the program. From the `IDLE` you can create a new file using `Ctrl + N` and then start writing the code\n",

    "## Variables and Data Types\n",
    "\n",
    "In programming, a variable is a symbolic name that refereces or stores data. The data is stored in memory and the variable is a human-friendly way of referencing that memory instead of using strange hexa-decimal values like `Oxxx122` to refer to memory. A variable can also be thought of as a container or box that stores items in it; these item(s) are the actual data.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Features of Python Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- Dynamically-typed: The type of a variable is determined at runtime\n",
    "- Case sensitive: `myVar` differs from `myvar`\n",
    "- Re-assignment: Variables can hold different types of data during execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Rules for Naming Variables:\n",
    "\n",
    "When you’re using variables in Python, you need to adhere to a few rules and guidelines. Breaking some of these rules will cause errors; other guidelines just help you write code that’s easier to read and understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Should be descriptive for better readability.\n",
    "- Can only contain letters, numbers, and/or underscores\n",
    "- Whitespaces, tabs, or new lines are not allowed when naming variables\n",
    "- Aphanumerical: Cannot start with a number.\n",
    "- Within it, only an underscore is used not any other special character like `#`\n",
    "- Cannot use Python keywords (e.g., `if`, `while`, `class`). A list of all Python keywords is in the image below.\\\n",
    "![python keywords](../pics/keywords.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\\\n",
    "\n",
    "Breaking these rules is most likely going to results in errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Defining variables\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining a variable, there are three important components whicha re\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variable name: this is then name which should abide to the rules above.\n",
    "- Assignment operator is `=`\n",
    "- Value is the actual data you want to store in the variable"
